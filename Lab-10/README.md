# README: Fundamentals of Training an Image Classification Model

This guide gives you a high-level road map and resources for training your own image‐classification model. It covers key concepts, data organization, modeling steps, and evaluation—all in general terms so you can apply them to any business or domain scenario.

## 1. Overview & Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you should be able to:  
- Organize an image dataset into training, validation, and test splits  
- Choose an appropriate model architecture (from scratch or via transfer learning)  
- Configure and run a training loop with data augmentation  
- Monitor performance and diagnose issues (overfitting, underfitting)  
- Evaluate final model quality and understand next‐step enhancements

## 2. Essential Concepts

1. **Dataset Splits**  
   - **Training set** (~70–80%): used to update model weights  
   - **Validation set** (~10–15%): used to tune hyperparameters and detect overfitting  
   - **Test set** (~10–15%): held out until final evaluation

2. **Data Augmentation**  
   - Creates new training examples via transformations (rotations, flips, color jitter)  
   - Improves generalization when you have limited data  
   - Resource: [Keras ImageDataGenerator](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/image/ImageDataGenerator)

3. **Transfer Learning vs. Training from Scratch**  
   - **From scratch**: define your own CNN; requires large datasets & compute  
   - **Transfer learning**: reuse a pretrained network’s feature layers; freeze them initially, then fine-tune  
   - Resource: [TensorFlow Transfer Learning Guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning)

4. **Key Hyperparameters**  
   - **Learning rate**: step size for weight updates (often the single most important)  
   - **Batch size**: number of samples processed before updating weights  
   - **Epochs**: full passes over the training set  
   - **Regularization**: Dropout, weight decay to prevent overfitting

5. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - **Accuracy**: proportion of correct predictions  
   - **Confusion matrix**: class-level error analysis  
   - **Precision/Recall/F1**: especially important for imbalanced classes  
   - Resource: [Scikit-learn Metrics](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html)

## 3. Data Organization & Structure

Your project directory should look like:
project_root/
│
├─ data/
│ ├─ train/ # training images
│ │ ├─ class_A/
│ │ └─ class_B/
│ ├─ val/ # validation images
│ │ ├─ class_A/
│ │ └─ class_B/
│ └─ test/ # test images
│ ├─ class_A/
│ └─ class_B/
│
├─ notebooks/
│ └─ Lab10_image_classification.ipynb
│
├─ models/ # saved model weights
│
└─ README.md

- Place images into subfolders named by class label.  
- Keep validation and test sets strictly separate from training.

## 4. High-Level Training Workflow

1. **Environment Setup**  
   - Install core libraries: `tensorflow`, `pytorch`, `torchvision`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`.  
   - Resource: [Getting Started with TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) or [PyTorch Quickstart](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

2. **Data Loading & Augmentation**  
   - Use a data‐loader or generator to read folder structure.  
   - Apply real-time augmentations on the training set; only rescale/normalize on validation/test.

3. **Model Definition**  
   - **Option A:** Build a small custom CNN (3–5 convolutional blocks).  
   - **Option B:** Load a pretrained model (e.g., ResNet50, MobileNetV2) and attach a new classification head.

4. **Compile & Configure**  
   - Choose an optimizer (Adam, SGD + momentum).  
   - Set loss function (categorical cross-entropy for multi-class).  
   - Define metrics (accuracy, optionally precision/recall).

5. **Training Loop**  
   - Train for a moderate number of epochs (e.g., 10–20)  
   - Monitor training & validation loss/accuracy each epoch  
   - Use callbacks: early stopping, model checkpointing

6. **Evaluation & Analysis**  
   - Evaluate final performance on the test set  
   - Plot and interpret a confusion matrix  
   - Inspect misclassified examples to spot patterns

7. **Next Steps & Fine-Tuning**  
   - Unfreeze part of the pretrained base and continue training at a lower learning rate  
   - Experiment with different architectures or hyperparameter schedules  
   - Deploy your model as a REST API or on-device inference (TensorFlow Lite, ONNX)

## 6. Tips for Success

- **Start Small:** Begin with a tiny subset of your data to validate your pipeline.  
- **Visualize Often:** Plot samples, augmentations, and learning curves to catch issues early.  
- **Keep Iterating:** Use validation feedback to refine augmentations, architectures, and hyperparameters.  
- **Document Everything:** Record your experiments—model versions, hyperparameters, and results—for reproducibility.
