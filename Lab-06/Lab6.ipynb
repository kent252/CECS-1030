    "## 1. Selection Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept**:\n",
    "Selection Sort divides the input list into two parts: a sorted part and an unsorted part. It repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps**:\n",
    "1. Start from the first index.\n",
    "2. Find the minimum element in the unsorted part.\n",
    "3. Swap it with the element at the current index.\n",
    "4. Move to the next index and repeat until the list is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "Input: `64 25 12 22 11`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pass 1: Find the minimum (`11`) and swap with `64` → `11 25 12 22 64`\n",
    "- Pass 2: Minimum is `12`, swap with `25` → `11 12 25 22 64`\n",
    "- Pass 3: Minimum is `22`, swap with `25` → `11 12 22 25 64`\n",

    "## 2. Bubble Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept**:\n",
    "Bubble Sort works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. It continues to \"bubble\" the largest element to the end in each pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps**:\n",
    "1. Compare adjacent elements.\n",
    "2. Swap them if they are in the wrong order.\n",
    "3. Continue through the list until no swaps are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "Input: `5 1 4 2 8`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pass 1: `1 4 2 5 8`\n",
    "- Pass 2: `1 2 4 5 8`\n",
    "- Pass 3: `1 2 4 5 8` (No swaps → sorted)\n",

    "## 3. Merge Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept**:\n",
    "Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It divides the input list into halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps**:\n",
    "1. Divide the list into two halves.\n",
    "2. Recursively sort each half.\n",
    "3. Merge the sorted halves into one sorted list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "Input: `38 27 43 3 9 82 10`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Divide: `[38 27 43]` and `[3 9 82 10]`\n",
    "- Further divide: `[38] [27 43]`, `[3 9] [82 10]`\n",
    "- Merge: `[27 38 43]`, `[3 9]`, `[10 82]`\n",
    "- Final Merge: `3 9 10 27 38 43 82`\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Output: `3 9 10 27 38 43 82`\n"

    "Each sorting algorithm has its advantages and use cases:\n",
    "- **Selection Sort** is simple but not efficient for large datasets.\n",

    "- **Merge Sort** is more efficient and scalable for larger lists.\n",
